Description: The Gini concentration test for survival data is a nonparametric test based on the Gini index for testing the equality of two survival distributions from the point of view of concentration. The package compares different nonparametric tests (asymptotic Gini test, permutation Gini test, log-rank test, Gray-Tsiatis test and Wilcoxon test) and computes their p-values.
